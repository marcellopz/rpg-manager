# RPG Campaign Manager: A Solution for Tabletop RPG Campaign Management

Project Website: [https://campaign-hub.vercel.app/](https://campaign-hub.vercel.app/)

I created the 'RPG Campaign Manager', a practical solution for managing tabletop RPG campaigns. This project, developed using React and TypeScript and hosted on Vercel, is designed to provide a user-friendly, mobile-friendly and efficient experience. It leverages a robust Firebase backend and GitLab for version control.

The 'RPG Campaign Manager' is structured to support a collaborative environment for RPG players and game masters. It features a dual-section campaign area: a public section for all registered campaign players, and a private section for individual player information. The layout, inspired by Microsoft OneNote, divides the interface into categories and subcategories for straightforward organization.

Each subcategory in the system is versatile, accommodating text drafting with Markdown formatting, character inventory management, and character sheet creation and editing. A significant aspect of this project is its responsive design, ensuring that users can view and edit content easily on any device, which is particularly important during RPG sessions.

The 'RPG Campaign Manager' is crafted to streamline the RPG gameplay experience and assist in efficient campaign management.
